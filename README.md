# Discussion_Heatmap
A plugin to visually show consensus and contradiction in collaborative writing tools like Wikis.

## Vision
Imagine a plugin for a Wiki, a Google Doc, or another collaborative writing tool like a public Word365 document where passages, paragraphs, or words that are broadly accepted get a light green background, whereas text passages that raise contradictions and which are highly disputed get an orange background. The more orange the background the more controversial the discussion about this text. The more green, the more consensus. 
On mouseover, you immediately get a summary of the discussion which might result from a long history of edits and comments on this topic. Maybe even with graphical or statistical representations of the discussion and sorted lists of links from the discussion.

This might be another tool for crafting better cooperative texts and to ensure better understanding of the other side.
